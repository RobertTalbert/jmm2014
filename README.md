Greetings. This repository contains documents and other items used by me, [Robert Talbert](http://proftalbert.com), at the Joint Mathematics Meetings held in January 2014 in Baltimore, Maryland. These include slides for the following talks: 

- "A different type of math": Addressing student difficulties with proof by flipping the transition-to-proof course
- Peer Instruction in Linear Algebra
- Inverting the transition-to-proof course
- Technology as tool for self-regulated learning in an inverted calculus course
- Panel presentation on assessment in non-traditional mathematics courses
